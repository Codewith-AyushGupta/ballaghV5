# Quick Instructions

- download repo
- run npm install -f
- create copy of env.example and use it as .env
- add the tenant varaiables in .env
- test on local server run "npm start" ( env variables don't work on index.html on local host )
- npm run build to build the package
- npm run build:replace ( to modify the index.html with .env)
- put all the content of build folder in S3 ( don't put the data with build folder )

# WARNING

If you drag and drop a file to s3, ensure to go to all files and make public using ACL

# To deploy to go live

- ensure the env files are correct. (ensure s3 bucket is correct)
- Run command npm build
- drag and drop the contents up
- run the npm build database file (maybe this is a wrapper.)
- drag and drop the images up to s3.
- if needed, delete the files for the collection from s3 before uploading the new ones.
- try to

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
